# TERMS OF SERVICE — {{STORE_NAME}} (EN)
**Version:** v1.1  
**Effective date:** 2026-02-16  
**Summary:** These Terms govern the purchase and use of digital products for Minecraft (plugins, configurations, maps, source code and downloadable content) offered by **{{STORE_NAME}}** (“we”, “us”, “the Store”). By purchasing, accessing or downloading, you agree to these Terms.

---

## 1) Definitions
- **Digital Product:** downloadable or digitally accessible files (ZIP, JAR, schematics, maps, configs, source code, etc.).
- **Order:** a purchase recorded in the Store.
- **Delivery / Download:** access to files via link/token and/or the “My Downloads” area.
- **Staged Delivery:** partial delivery (e.g., preview or compiled build) and/or full delivery (e.g., full source) released according to Store rules or administrative approval.
- **Evidence/Logs:** technical records of the transaction and access (timestamps, encrypted IP, User-Agent, file hashes, system events, download events, etc.).
- **Effective delivery:** a Digital Product is considered delivered when it is **made available** to the buyer (e.g., a download token/link is generated and enabled) and/or when there is evidence of **successful access/download** (e.g., `download.completed`).

---

## 2) Acceptance, eligibility and minimum age
By using the Store, you confirm that:
- You have legal capacity to contract, or you act with authorization from the payment method holder.
- You understand that Digital Products are delivered electronically and may be made available immediately after payment confirmation.
- **Minimum age / minors:** you must be **at least 16 years old** to purchase, or purchase under the authorization and supervision of an adult/payment method holder (as required by applicable law). If you are a minor, do not complete a purchase without such authorization.

---

## 3) Products, compatibility and descriptions
- Product descriptions, compatibility and requirements (Minecraft versions, Paper/Spigot, dependencies, etc.) are provided on the product page.
- We make reasonable efforts to keep information up to date, but results may vary depending on your hosting, third-party plugins, versions, or server configuration.
- We recommend testing in a staging environment before production use.

---

## 4) Pricing, taxes and currency
- Prices are displayed in the currency shown on the website (e.g., USD).
- Taxes, fees and bank/payment processor charges may vary by country and are the buyer’s responsibility unless stated otherwise.

---

## 5) Payments and verification
- Payments are processed through providers such as PayPal or other officially integrated gateways.
- An Order is considered **paid** when the payment is **confirmed** by the processor, for example:
  - via a validated **webhook/event**, and/or
  - via **API verification** (e.g., confirming “COMPLETED/CAPTURED” status via the provider’s API).
- We do not guarantee download availability if the payment is pending, under review, disputed or reversed.
- We may hold or limit delivery when there are reasonable risk signals (fraud, abuse, unauthorized use, identity inconsistencies).

---

## 6) Digital delivery, links and limits
To protect buyers and the Store:
- Download links may expire (e.g., 15 minutes per token).
- Download count/time limits apply (e.g., 3 downloads within 7 days), as indicated in the product or Order.
- Files are delivered via signed links/tokens; we do not publish public direct URLs.
- We may block or limit downloads upon reasonable signs of abuse, unauthorized use or fraud risk.

---

## 7) Staged Delivery
Some products may be delivered in stages, for example:
- **Preview/compiled stage:** initial access to a build or partial content.
- **Full/source stage:** full delivery of source code or complete deliverables.

Staged release may depend on:
- Payment confirmation,
- Download limit compliance,
- Reasonable verification of payment method ownership (when applicable),
- Administrative security decisions (e.g., high dispute risk).

> Note: If a product is delivered “in stages”, this must be indicated on the product page or description.

---

## 8) No-refund policy (Digital Products)
**Due to the digital nature** (instant delivery and copyability), as a general rule:
- Purchases are **non-refundable** once the product has been **delivered or made available** for download (token/link enabled) and, especially, when there is evidence of **successful download/access** (e.g., `download.completed`).
- Refunds may be available only if required by applicable law (e.g., mandatory consumer protection rules).

In case of genuine technical issues:
- We may offer reasonable support or replacement at our discretion, provided the issue is reproducible and not caused by the buyer’s environment.

---

## 9) License (permitted use)
Unless a product states otherwise, we grant a license that is:
- **Non-exclusive, non-transferable**, for personal use or internal use within the buyer’s server/organization.
- Associated with the Order and may include fingerprints/identifiers (see Section 10).

---

## 10) Prohibited uses
**You may not:**
- resell, redistribute, sublicense, share or publish the product (or substantial parts) in repositories, forums, marketplaces, Discord servers, etc.
- allow third parties to download using your links or “My Downloads” access
- remove license notices, marks, or embedded identifiers.

---

## 11) Watermarking, licenses and fingerprints
To protect content and mitigate fraud:
- Certain products (especially source code) may include a **license block**, **identifiers** or **fingerprints** tied to the Order (e.g., order_id, email, date, fingerprint).
- These elements do not affect functionality but help verify origin in case of redistribution or disputes.

---

## 12) Technical evidence, logs and disputes
The Store may record events and metadata for:
- operating the delivery system,
- fraud prevention,
- support,
- and dispute/chargeback responses.

This may include (among others):
- UTC timestamps,
- Terms acceptance (version + hash),
- encrypted and masked IP,
- User-Agent,
- access/download logs (including `download.button_clicked` and `download.completed` when applicable),
- file SHA256 hashes,
- payment events (IDs and statuses).

**Important:** these records are used as technical/operational evidence. We do not guarantee outcomes in disputes, as final decisions are made by the payment processor and/or card issuer.

---

## 13) Suspension, revocation and “dispute mode”
We may reasonably **suspend or revoke** access/downloads if:
- anomalous activity is detected,
- a dispute/chargeback is opened,
- payment is reversed,
- these Terms are breached.

In “dispute mode” we may:
- freeze evidence tied to the Order,
- revoke active links,
- preserve an evidence bundle (e.g., PDF) for the Order.

---

## 14) Support
- Support (if offered) is limited to what is stated on each product.
- It does not include server administration, installation of third-party plugins, or hosting issues.
- Response times may vary by timezone and volume.

---

## 15) Limitation of liability
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:
- We are not liable for indirect losses (lost profits, data loss, server downtime, reputation loss, etc.).
- Our total liability for an Order shall not exceed the amount paid for that product, unless required otherwise by law.
- We do not guarantee error-free operation in all environments, as behavior depends on versions, plugins and user configuration.

---

## 16) Service and content changes
- We may update products (patches, improvements) or discontinue them.
- We may update these Terms. The version accepted at purchase is recorded as evidence for that Order.

---

## 17) Governing law and jurisdiction
- These Terms are interpreted under the law of the **country where the legal owner/operator of {{STORE_NAME}} operates** (**{{LEGAL_COUNTRY}}**, when applicable), unless mandatory consumer protection laws in your country provide otherwise.
- Disputes shall be submitted to competent courts as applicable.

> Note: Once you define a legal entity (e.g., a company in Chile), fill `{{LEGAL_COUNTRY}}` and, if appropriate, the city/court.
